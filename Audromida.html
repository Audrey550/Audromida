            <p>Hey there! I'm Audrey, a 28 year old Digital Experience Design student based in Belgium with a big passion for all things creative. Growing up, I spent most of my time drawing, painting, and crafting - heavily inspired by the cartoons I loved. People always told me to "do something with my art", but I wasn't sure what that meant. After highschool, I put creativity aside and worked in retail... Until Covid-19 hit. During lockdown, I reconnected with my creative side - and stumbled upon a YouTube tutorial about coding. That was the moment it all clicked! I'd found a way to combine creativity with technoligy. Today, I specialize in front-end development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build responsive, user-friendly websites. I design using Figma, Illustrator and Blender, and I've explored some backend basics to better understand full workflows and work more effectively in teams. I love experimenting with new tools and always try to bring a fresh skill into every project - wether it's for school or personal growth. I'm currently open to intership opportunities where I can grow, collaborate, and contribute to real-world digital experiences.

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> YouthAWear was such a fun project to work on! For our final project of the first schoolyear, we were tasked with creating a digital product to raise awareness about substainible fashion. I chose to desgin an online learning platform aimed at childeren aged 12 to 18. Trough a series of interactive quiz-style games, users can learn about substainiblity in fashion in a fun and engaging way. They can also create and costumize their own avatars using a variety of substainible clothing options, which they can "buy" and try on within the platform.</p>
